This is my responsive portfolio, designed to be viewed in widths of 400px, 768px and 992px,
 but any width will still display the page. I used Bootstrap as well as my own CSS to create
 responsive page elements which resize themselves to fit different screens.

 ## Tools and Formats Used:
 __________________________  
 Github, CSS, html, and Bootstrap were used to build the design of the site.  
 I found free open source pictures on unsplash.com and pexel.com which I used to enhance the site's visuals.

 ## Sample Code:
 ________________  
Code for container block for home page:  
```
  <div class="container-xs p-3 mx-3 mt-5 bg-white">
    <div class="h1 border-bottom p-3"><strong>About Me</strong></div>
    <img src="Profile Pic.jpg" style="margin-right:10px;height:200px;width:200px" class="float-start" alt="Profile -- James Merges">

        Hi! My name is James Merges, welcome to my site. I am an aspiring code monkey and I love to play music and video games in my free time. I am new to this whole website design thing, but my experience in other coding areas prepared me pretty well. I am excited to tackle new projects and expand my horizons.
